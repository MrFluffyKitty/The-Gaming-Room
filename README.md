# The-Gaming-Room
CS 230

The Gaming Room is the client for a game called Draw it or Lose it. Draw it or Lose it was created on android and the client wishes to expand their operating platforms. The game needs to have one or more teams and each team can have multiple players. Team names must be unique. Lastly, the game can only have one instance at a time. The game uses four rounds of guessing a picture taken from a stock library. The team at bat has 30 seconds to guess the picture or the other teams get a chance for 15 seconds afterwards. The game needs to be web-based.
Overall, I had a pretty decent concept for developing The Gaming Room documentation. I think I did particularly well in explaining the set up of the Domain Model. The model itself was rather simple but contained many different methods which could make one feel lost.
Developing code can be a challenge, but the design document provided a brief but solid layout to work upon.
If I was to change anything in this document, it would have to bve the evaluation. The evalution that I created felt random and made to fit. I would do more research and properly give the correct information for each evaluation.
The users needs are a must for developing software. Even if you might not entirely agree with what the user wants in the software, the user is still the employer, so you need to develop the software to their specific standards. You need clients to work after all. 
The UML design was incredibly helpful with developing software. The techniques of using UML is now a must have for when I create software in the future.
